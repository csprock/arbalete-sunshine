"""
Module to load one building and its matching roof from the File Geodatabase, by matching
via spatial intersection of 2D footprints.

This example uses the "Building_solid" layer to load one building and the "Roof_solid"
layer to search for a roof whose 2D footprint intersects the building's footprint. The
building is extruded using its computed height. For the roof, we re-extrude its 2D
footprint to a fixed thickness (0.2 m) and then align it vertically with the building
(i.e. translating the roof so that its bottom equals the buildingâ€™s top). The combined
result can then be exported or further processed.
